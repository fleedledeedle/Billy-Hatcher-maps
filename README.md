# Billy-Hatcher-maps
fork of SaltContainer's github pages for Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus infographics, to use for Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg resources: https://github.com/SaltContainer/SaltContainer.github.io  
I want to copy SaltContainer's and Altissimo's map ideas, as in this interactive PL:A map set: https://github.com/Altissimo1/altissimo1.github.io  
Hopefully pairs with Exeloar's 100% tracker program for Billy: https://github.com/BHSpeedruns/Billy-Hatcher-Progress-Tracker

## Goals
- Make an interactive version of maps for Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg. Currently hosting them on the BHSpeedruns Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1baAUOIxnTnXen9XFaz6VkG4q3ZMuHILO 
- Have info for eggs as hover tooltips (egg no. & name, picture of contents, fruit amount to hatch, links to other levels found in)
- Add other map info as toggleable layers (enemies, chick coins, minigame coins, switches/gates/hoops/cages)
